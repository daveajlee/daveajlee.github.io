        <h3 class="margin text-center">MDISCIS – MiniDISC Information System</h3>
        <p>MDISCIS is a java program which acts as an information system for Minidiscs. Minidiscs do not allow artists and titles to be saved as track information. As a consequence, I developed MDISCIS in January 2003 as a solution to this problem. It acts as an information system for Minidiscs. The program has since then been regularly updated for new Java versions. MDISCIS is an open source project.</p>
