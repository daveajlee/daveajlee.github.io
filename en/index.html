        <p>In March 2010, I was awarded my Doctor of Philosophy degree after a successful defence of my doctoral thesis entitled “Hybrid Algorithms for Distributed Constraint Satisfaction”. I have many years of practical software development, architecture and modelling in addition to my degrees. I have also developed a number of freely available software programmes as well as web sites for various organisations.</p>
        <p>I also hold a First Class Honours Bachelor of Science degree from the Robert Gordon University. During my studies, I received a number of awards.</p>
        <p>I am currently working as Software Architect with myToys.de GmbH in Berlin, Germany.</p>
