        <h3 class="margin text-center">Ausbildung und Qualifikationen</h3>
        <p>Born in 1985, I developed an interest in computing at an early age. After completing my Highers/A Levels with excellent grades, I was awarded an unconditional place to study Computing for Business and E-Commerce at the Robert Gordon University Aberdeen. During my degree, I achieved excellent grades for which I was rewarded with three academic achievement awards. I was also awarded three scholarships to undertake summer research projects. In July 2006, I graduated with a First Class Bachelor of Science Honours Degree in Computing for Business and E-Commerce. Upon completion of my Honours Degree, I was offered a PhD scholarship. The research I undertook resulted in four research publications as well as numerous presentations and seminars internationally delivered. In March 2010, I was awarded my Doctor of Philosophy degree from the <a href="www.comp.rgu.ac.uk">School of Computing</a> at the <a href="www.rgu.ac.uk">Robert Gordon University</a> after a successful defence of my doctoral thesis entitled “Hybrid Algorithms for Distributed Constraint Satisfaction”.</p>

        <h3 class="margin text-center">Career</h3>
        <p>From August 2010 until June 2014, I worked as a Software Developer for <a href="www.mytoys.de">mytoys.de GmbH</a> in Berlin, Germany. I was responsible primarily for developing backend e-commerce systems in Java with REST interfaces. Since July 2014, I am working as a Software Architect for <a href="www.mytoys.de">mytoys.de GmbH</a> in Berlin, Germany where I combine my passions of research, software design and development to design, develop and implement optimal solutions for a wide range of e-commerce problems.</p>
