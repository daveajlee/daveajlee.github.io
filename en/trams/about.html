        <h3 class="margin text-center">What is TraMS?</h3>
        <p>TraMS is freeware and open source. TraMS seeks to fulfil a small unfulfilled niche area in Transport Games – namely managing a complex transport company. You have to make quick decisions with finite resources to keep your revenues coming in – passengers will not wait!</p>

        <h3 class="margin text-center">Aims and Objectives of TraMS</h3>
        <p>The program aims to simulate the daily workings of a transport operator. The main activities which TraMS seeks to simulate are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>The creation of a route network and procurement of sufficient vehicles so that the route network can be run efficiently.</p></li>
            <li><p>Daily allocation of vehicles to routes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Challenges, during each day, which may cause your vehicles to run early or late.</p></li>
            <li><p>>Daily summary of passenger satisfaction.</p></li>
        </ol>
      
        <p>At the end of each day, you must get a minimum level of passenger satisfaction or your transport company will go out of business.</p>
